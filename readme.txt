First Project on GitHUB.

The idea is to build a website where Dark Souls players can showcase their fashion or other type of images.

They submit an image, give it a Title and short Description.  

People can then vote: 
Appraise
Disparage

There will be three main browsing categories: 

Got Gud - a lot of appraisals
Convoluted - a balance between appraisals and disparages
Casul - a lot of disparages

This readMe serves as a progress log of thoughts on the project.

Later on:

Image comment system based on dark souls type messaging.

The overall functionality should remain simple.

Fully fledged user base seems a bit too much.
Anonymous users can post images and vote.
Search function to locate desired image as a way of users to track their images. (later use cookies?)



Functionality:

How to keep bots from flooding the site? – Captcha!
How to keep bots from voting?

Integrity: 

How to keep the images uploaded on par with the website’s theme?

How to deal with Undesirable images (porn, etc)?
