First Project on GitHUB.

The idea is to build a website where dark souls players can showcase their fashion.

They submit an image, give it a title and short description. 

People can then vote: 
appraise
disaprove

there will be three main browsing categories: 
Got Gud - a lot of appraisals
Convoluted - a balance between appraisals and disprovals
Casul - a lot of disprovals

Later on:

comment system based on dark souls type messaging.
