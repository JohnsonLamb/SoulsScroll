First Project on GitHUB.

The idea is to build a website where Dark Souls players can showcase their fashion or other type of images.

They submit an image, give it a Title and short Description.  

People can then vote: 
Appraise
Disparage

There will be three main browsing categories: 

Got Gud - a lot of appraisals
Convoluted - a balance between appraisals and disparages
Casul - a lot of disparages

This readMe serves as a progress log of thoughts on the project.

Later on:

Image comment system based on dark souls type messaging.

The overall functionality should remain simple.

Fully fledged user base seems a bit too much.
Anonymous users can post images and vote.
Search function to locate desired image as a way of users to track their images. (later use cookies?)



Functionality:

How to keep bots from flooding the site? – Captcha!
How to keep bots from voting?

Integrity: 

How to keep the images uploaded on par with the website’s theme?

How to deal with Undesirable images (porn, etc)?

When uploading images it should be possible to say from which game they are from so that in the future the content can be separated by Game (demon souls, darks souls 1,2 & 3 and Bloodborne)

Also, flavor text on the website should reflect the Game that is being viewed (Dark souls 2 - hollow, undead, Dark Souls 3 - ashen one, unkindled)

How to keep the images uploaded on par with the website’s theme?

After pressing upload: 
-use a small quiz with soulsborne related questions and give a score at the end. 
-have the option to opt out of the quiz.
-after opting out, if it's the first time uploading, ask more questions.
